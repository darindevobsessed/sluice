target: Make the add video flow feel special with personality, celebrations, and storytelling loading states
focus: UX delight and engagement

goals:
  - Celebrate the transcript auto-fetch magic moment with dynamic copy and sparkles
  - Transform success state with milestone detection and what's next guidance
  - Replace generic loading spinners with storytelling progress messages

notes: |
  Inspired by creative analysis of Add Video and Add Transcript pages.
  Focus on emotional moments: first magic (transcript fetch), achievement (success),
  and engagement (loading states). Keep it tasteful — personality without gimmicks.
