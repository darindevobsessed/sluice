target: Semantic search with vector embeddings
focus: Infrastructure for AI-powered knowledge retrieval

goals:
  - Replace SQLite with Postgres + PG Vector (Neon-ready)
  - Auto-fetch transcripts programmatically (no manual paste)
  - Generate embeddings locally with FastEmbed
  - Implement RAG search that understands meaning, not just keywords

  ## Brad's Guidance

  > "Use Postgres. You can do Postgres has an embedding feature, and so you can create a rag with this."
  > "Instead of using OpenAI's embedding API... you can use fast embed. Fast embed will run locally."
  > "Try to make the transcript programmatic."

  ## Key Decisions
  - Node-only transcript extraction (youtube-transcript npm) — Python fallback later if needed
  - Local-first development, but architect for Neon deployment
  - Chunk transcripts with timestamp metadata for future temporal queries
