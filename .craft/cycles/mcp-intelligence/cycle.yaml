target: External API access and advanced RAG capabilities
focus: MCP server, graph relationships, temporal awareness, automation

goals:
  - Expose knowledge base via MCP for external tools (Slingshot, etc.)
  - Add Graph RAG for chunk-to-chunk relationships
  - Add Temporal Graph RAG to prevent outdated information
  - Automate content ingestion via cron jobs + RSS

  ## Brad's Guidance

  > "Once you've added the rag, you can add an MCP API to your GoldMiner. And then now I can programmatically access that RAG information."
  > "You can do graph rag. All you're doing is comparing the chunks with each other."
  > "Once you add a temporal graph rag, it will say, oh, he talked about this version of cursor. A new one came out. This one is outdated."
  > "Cron Job, RSS, new video, programmatic extract, database, queue trigger agent to summarize, summarized, done."

  ## Key Decisions
  - MCP tools: search_rag, get_list_of_creators (composable API)
  - Graph relationships stored in Postgres (not separate graph DB)
  - Temporal metadata: version mentions, release dates, freshness signals
  - Next.js built-in cron for scheduling
