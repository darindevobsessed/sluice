  ## Decisions Locked During Planning

  - **Navigation:** Sidebar nav (Linear-style)
  - **Pages:** Knowledge Bank, Add Video, Discovery, Settings
  - **Storage:** SQLite embedded database (localhost)
  - **Claude:** Uses local agent token via SDK, not user-provided API key
  - **Settings:** Full settings (theme, preferences, data export)
  - **Add Video:** Two-step form with auto-metadata extraction
  - **Knowledge Bank:** Card grid + full-page detail + FTS5 search
  - **Claude Actions:** Full suite (insights, training docs, summaries, quizzes, code snippets, plugin suggestions)
  - **Discovery:** RSS-based channel subscriptions, grouped by channel
  - **Design:** Rich green primary (#059669), Inter font, rounded cards
