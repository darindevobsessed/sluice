target: Quality-of-life improvements that make existing features more polished, reliable, and user-friendly
focus: UX polish, reliability, developer experience

goals:
  - Make transcript Source field optional and give transcripts visual identity with SVG icon
  - Auto-generate embeddings on video creation for immediate searchability
  - Add channel filter to discovery page for focused browsing

notes: |
  Decisions locked:
  - channel column stays named 'channel' but becomes nullable (2026-02-09)
  - Transcript SVG icon everywhere thumbnails appear (2026-02-09)
  - Auto-embed runs in background after POST, embed button stays as re-embed fallback
  - Discovery filter is a single-select dropdown of followed channels
