# Story: UI Enhancements

## Spark

Improve the video detail page layout based on Brad's feedback. Move insights above transcript — users want the extracted value first, raw transcript second. Add tabbed content topics at the root level for focus area navigation.

> *"Put. Put insights before the transcript. I I like that the transcript's there. It's the first thing I wanna see. I wanna see insights."*
> *"So maybe then what I need is, like, a profile. Not a profile, but kinda like a yeah, almost like a profile selector. Instead of having within the knowledge bank having different categories, we just have, like, a root level category tab. That we can go through."*
> *"Like, focus areas, something like that."*

**Focus areas** = root-level category tabs that filter the entire knowledge bank view. Not tags within a video, but a top-level organization paradigm.

- Focus areas: Tech, Business, Productivity, etc. (user-defined?)
- Tab persistence across sessions
- "All" tab to see everything
