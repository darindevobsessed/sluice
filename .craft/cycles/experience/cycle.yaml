target: Polished UI and advanced creator interactions
focus: UI enhancements, discovery redesign, persona agents

goals:
  - Improve content layout (insights first, tabbed focus areas)
  - Redesign discovery with catch-up and similar creator suggestions
  - Enable persona agents per creator and ensemble conversations
  - Keep it agnostic — platform, not niche tool

  ## Brad's Guidance

  > "Put insights before the transcript... I wanna see insights."
  > "Almost like a profile selector. Instead of having within the knowledge bank having different categories, we just have, like, a root level category tab."
  > "I wanna catch up. Give me a catch up page."
  > "For your discovery, you should find similar creators."
  > "Once you have that, you can create a persona agent... it automatically creates a persona agent."
  > "I also want a I wanna talk to an ensemble."

  ## Key Decisions
  - Chat sidebar: holding off for now
  - Catch-up merges into discovery page
  - Personas auto-created at transcript threshold
  - Keep agnostic: "Make it the knowledge base. Don't try to add too many agent things."

  ## Design Principle
  > "Why is the AR-15 platform so popular? It's because you can put this accessory, that accessory... You have this base and just keep it the base."
